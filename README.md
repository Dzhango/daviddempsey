## 🌊 Hey there! I'm David

I'm a third year Computer Science student at UC San Diego. Recently, I've been mostly working on full-stack web and mobile development projects. Outside of school and work, I love to cook for my friends and family, go snowboarding, and surf at Scripps Beach. Thanks for checking out my profile!
 
 
 ## 🏂 Current Involvements

 * I'm currently working as the Head Computer Science Tutor for Professor Niema Moshiri's CSE 100 (Advanced Data Structures: C++).
 
 * I recently founded my startup [Muse, a social network designed to bring people together through their similar music tastes](https://www.muuse.app). We're still very early on in development, but we're hoping to launch by this summer! 
 
 * I've been working with high schools in disadvantaged areas of San Diego to help organize and teach computer science programs and labs with CS foreach. You can learn more about us [here](https://csforeach.ucsd.edu/)!
 
 * With ACM Hack, I've been creating and teaching web development and Python workshops. You can check these out on the [ACM UCSD YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpmCTDt8lemUcpBJquYLrfcQLc919tI2g)!
